#### Single-line Summary
Today we modified the starter code to make it responsive for mobile and desktop applications.


#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. We added a meta tag that to set up the viewport and proper scale.
  2. By using a span tag we added the menu icon which was in the wrong position.
  3. We switched roles and then proceeded to 'float' the menu-icon to the right side of the page.
  4. Next we configured our app to respond to the size of the screen. Above 640px the nav menu would appear with links inlined.
  Below 640px the nav menu would disappear and the hamburger menu would appear. Clicking on the burger menu would show the
  nav menu links blocked.
